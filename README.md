### Requirements
* Active internet connection
* Fedora Linux (32 or above and Rawhide)
* Device with a discrete NVIDIA GPU

### Installation
If you use Fedora Linux (32 or above and Rawhide) - you can install NVIDIA Auto Installer for Fedora by enabling my 
COPR repository. Simply execute the following commands in succession to install the tool.

```shell
# dnf install dnf-plugins-core -y
# dnf copr enable t0xic0der/nvidia-auto-installer-for-fedora -y
# dnf install nvautoinstall -y
```

### Usage
1. Make sure you have a working internet connection
2. Install the tool from COPR with the above instructions
3. Execute `nvautoinstall` to check installation modes
4. Run the installation modes according to your needs
5. Give stars to the repository if you found this helpful

### Modes of installation
Active internet connection and superuser privilege is required to execute the following installation modes.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall rpmadd`**  
  This mode enables the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall driver`**  
  This mode simply installs the NVIDIA drivers. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository is mandatory before 
  doing this.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall nvrepo`**  
  This mode enables the official NVIDIA repository for CUDA software.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall plcuda`**  
  This mode installs only the CUDA support softwares. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers and NVIDIA official 
  repository, and installing the basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall ffmpeg`**  
  This mode installs only the FFMPEG acceleration. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and installing the 
  basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall vulkan`**  
  This mode installs only the Vulkan renderer. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and installing the 
  basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall vidacc`**  
  This mode installs only the VDPAU/VAAPI acceleration. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and 
  installing the basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall getall`**  
  This mode installs all the above packages. (Not been implemented yet)
- **`sudo nvautoinstall cheksu`**  
  This mode allows you to check the current user privilege level. You can use this tool effectively only when you have 
  logged in as a root or sudo user.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall compat`**  
  This mode allows you to check your hardware and host compatibility. The tool would check your hardware and host and 
  tell if your device is supported by the tool or not.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall primec`**  
  This mode allows you to toggle the PRIME offloading to render all display elements using the discrete card. This has 
  only been tested on Workstation variant of Fedora Linux.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall cublas`**
  This mode installs the CuBLAS library. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and installing the 
  basic drivers and CUDA support software are mandatory before doing this.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall cudnn`**
  This mode installs the CuDNN library. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and installing the 
  basic drivers and CUDA support software are mandatory before doing this.
  **Warning: this mode adds the RHEL 8 repository, which is the only .rpm repository NVIDIA distributes for CuDNN. https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html#package-manager-rhel-install**
  
- **`sudo nvautoinstall --version`**  
  This mode shows the tool version and exits out.
- **`sudo nvautoinstall --help`**  
  This mode shows the help message and exits out.

### Note
* Active internet connection is required to download drivers.
* Requires secure boot to be turned off in UEFI systems.
* Requires superuser access for repo addition and driver setup.
* The drivers are fetched from the RPM Fusion repository.
* Use discretion while using this on other spins.
* Only tested on 9XX/10XX/20XX/30XX series discrete NVIDIA cards.
* Use discretion while installing with older discrete NVIDIA cards.
* No additional configuration is required for Optimus setups.
* Native support for PRIME configuration on Optimus.

### Coming soon
* CLI "Launch using Dedicated Graphics Card" option.
* Intuitive mode switching for hybrid graphics.
* Distinct mode for using integrated or discrete GPU.
* Experimental support for RHEL 8 and CentOS 8.
* Support for older cards by active querying at NVIDIA.

### Disclaimer
This tool has been tried and tested multiple times and is expected to work flawlessly in Fedora Linux (32 or above, 
and Rawhide). It has not been tested on any of the spins yet so you are requested to proceed with caution. While the 
chances of things going wrong is pretty slim, you would still want to make backups, should things do not go as expected. 
As always, you are choosing to use this tool at your will and you cannot hold me responsible for any mishap that may 
occur due to the misuse of this tool.
